# Mario-Kart-Quiz
MADE BY: Jeremy Poulin

24h Take-home quiz done for COMP376 with pre-given assets and map composition.


TOP-DOWN VIEW CHANGES:

The only changes that have been made for the different view is in regard to the camera used.

When in the Top-down view, the camera is in orthographic mode to get a better sense of the course while also being more intuitive.

When in 3D view, a normal perspective camera is used since the game world (for this quiz) is not meant to be isometric.
